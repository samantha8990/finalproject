MURDER PART 2

Final Project Proposal
Ashley Aguayo, Arianne Toepfer, Bitty Fennie, 
Samantha Sommer, & Tracy Ammann<br>

Objective:
	To analyze trends with murder data from Project 2 but with less limitations on data quantity. This round, we explored both unsolved and solved cases from the years 2016-2019 rather than just unsolved crimes of 2019.
	We used Neural Network Mapping to accurately predict the gender of the offender as well as the solved or unsolved status of the specified murder. The final project is hosted on tableau public, with a storyboard and multiple interactive dashboards. The record of analysis found on Tableau public is listed below.

Charting:
1. Total Cases in US (Map)
2. Percentage of Cases per Capita using Census data from 2019
3. Gender Ratio by Population VS Offenders Gender (Map)
4. Offender by Gender Pie Chart
5. Victim by Gender Pie Chart
6. Solved vs Unsolved Trend
7. Top 10 Dangerous States by Total Murders
8. Top 10 Safest States by Total Murders
9. Weapon Bar Charts (One with Guns and one with Guns filtered out)
10. Bubble charts showing the relationship the Offender had with the victim VS Weapon Type (Also filtered with Guns and no Guns)
11. Monthly Murder Trends
12. Yearly Murder Trends
13. Murder by Stranger by State (Map)
14. Highest Cases of Stranger Murder (Top 10)
15. Highest Cases of Stranger Murder by Month

With the ease of Tableau, we were able to cover all items we wished we had in Project 2 as well as explore some unique data. We were able to isolate the Stranger relationship and find the most likely scenario on how a person could die by a Stranger's hand, or gun. This project was very fun and the whole team worked well together to deliver a cohesive project. <br>
