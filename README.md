MURDER PART 2

Final Project Proposal
Ashley Aguayo, Arianne Toepfer, Bitty Fennie, 
Samantha Sommer, & Tracy Ammann<br>

Objective:
	We want to analyze trends with murder data from our last project but with less limitations on data quantity. This round, we can explore both unsolved and solved cases from the years 2016-2019. On our last project we were only able to do unsolved 2016 data with the data limits of heroku. 
	We plan to use machine learning (sci-kit) to predict murder rates for 2020 after training our model with a portion of our known data. We know there will be some level of unpredictability taking into account COVID-19, but we will include this in our analysis. 
	From there we plan on hosting our final project on tableau public and creating a storyboard and interactive dashboards.

Data covering 2016-2019:
1. Trends by Year
2. Trends by Month
3. solved vs unsolved
4. Gender
5. weapon bar chart/pie chart
6. relationship chart
7. Map
8. Map-Census data correlations
9. Clean up murder weapon groupings
10. Predict solved/Unsolved, predict Gender (male/female)

Tenative Schedule:
1. Wednesday: Data Cleanup
2. Saturday/Monday: Analysis Prediction
3. Wednesday/Saturday: Charts in Tableau
